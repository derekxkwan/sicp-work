Some work I've been doing going through the famed "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". All Chapter 1 exercises are in Guile Scheme up to the Chapter 2 picture language ones which are written in Racket with the SICP module. Then I decided to give Chicken Scheme a shot (although I suppose there's quite little difference between it all the level I'm using them).
